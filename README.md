# opam2nix is experimental software

This repository is the code for the opam2nix program, which is used both to generate `nix` derivations and also during the build phase of those derivations. You should see the [opam2nix-packages](https://github.com/gfxmonk/opam2nix-packages) repository for more information on how to use this software.
